        "*Encapsulation* is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). The warpping up of data and functions into a single unit (called class) is known as *Encapsulation*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data is not accessible to the outside world, and only those functions which are wrapped in the class can access it. These functions provide the interface between the object's data and the program. Inhibiting access to the data by the program is called data hiding. For interacting with the object's data, it provides a controlled and secure interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "By hiding implementation details, encapsulation makes it easier to modify and maintain the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, *Encapsulation* can be achieved using private and protected access specifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Private Members: The private data variable name starts with double underscore(__). These members are not accessible from outside the class (Not even derived classes).\n",
        "* Protected Members: The protected data variable name starts with single underscore(_). These members are accessible within the class and its derived classes. *Although it is accessible outside of the class too, the convention is not to access it.*\n",
        "* public Members: The public data variables are not preceeded with any underscore. Although convention is to keep the data private for security and integrity reasons, but some data can be put as public too, if it doesn't harm the program's integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "All the data variables are initialized in two ways in Python-\n",
        "1. **Inside \\_\\_init__ method.** \\_\\_init__ method in Python is used to initialize objects of a class. It is also called a constructor. The variables declared inside the \\_\\_init__ method are called static variables. They are accessed by \"*self.*\".\n",
        "2. **Inside class and outside \\_\\_init__ method.** This variables are called class variables. They are accessed by \"*cls.*\".\n",

        "Consider a scenario of ATM. When using an ATM to withdraw money, several internal processes occur that are hidden from us. *Encapsulation* ensures that we interact with the ATM in a simple and secure manner without needing to know the intricate details of how it works internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "In an ATM, we swipe the ATM card and the machine take user information like \"card number\", \"card holder name\", \"expiration date\", \"CVV number\", etc. User also has to provide a 4-digit pin. The user cannot access the data directly or know the internal process details. He can only work with the options(here, methods) provided in the ATM machine screen.\n",
